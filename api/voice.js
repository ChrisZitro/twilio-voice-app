/**
 * TwiML endpoint used by the TwiML application to handle voice calls.
 *
 * When a call is initiated from the browser (via Twilio.Device.connect with a
 * `To` parameter), Twilio will request this endpoint and include the
 * destination phone number in the `To` parameter. This handler uses the
 * `<Dial>` verb with a `callerId` equal to your companyâ€™s Twilio number so
 * that the callee sees the main business phone on their caller ID. If
 * `To` is not provided, the endpoint responds with a short message; you can
 * customize this to play a greeting or route the call to available clients.
 *
 * Environment variables used:
 * - TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER: the Twilio number to display as caller ID
